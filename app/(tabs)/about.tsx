        players, teams, and
        fans, making it easier
        to follow matches,
        manage teams, and
        celebrate the spirit
        of cricket in our
        community. This
        Organization is
        committed to providing
        a platform for players
        to showcase their
        skills and for fans to
        engage with the game
        they love. This
        Organization was
        established in 2021 by
        Muhammad Masab and a
        group of passionate
        cricket enthusiasts
        who wanted to create a
        vibrant cricketing
        community. Since then,
        we have grown to

        cricket lovers,
        providing resources,
        support, and a
        platform for players
        to connect and

        Our mission is to
        promote the game of
        cricket at the
        grassroots level,
        encouraging
        participation,
        sportsmanship, and a
        sense of community
        among players and fans
        alike. We believe that
        cricket is more than
        just a sport; it's a
        way to bring people
        together, celebrate
        talent, and create
        lasting memories.
        Through our app, we
        aim to make cricket
        more accessible and
        enjoyable for
        everyone, from players
        to fans. Whether
